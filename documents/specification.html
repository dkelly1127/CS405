        <h2>Admin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each input in the admin pages has validation in it to prevent certain SQL injection techniques which would break the client side, or could delete entire databases</li>

            <li>The validation also makes sure that only relevant data can be added, for example, you can only add numbers for the price</li>

            <li>You are able to update product data, so if you make a mistake, or have to alter stock levels, you can quickly and easily do that</li>

            <li>Easy to use navigation</li>

            <li>Intuitive design</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Client</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Has a limit on the number of products that can be displayed on a page. This means that if you had a million products, it wouldn’t try to load them all</li>
            <li>A search function to make navigation easier</li>
            <li>Search functionality prevents SQL injection, so a customer can’t delete databases or alter product prices</li>
            <li>Automatically generated menu, which makes maintenance easy</li>
            <li>Easy navigation</li>
            <li>Intuitive design</li>
            <li>Clear and consistent page layout</li>
        </ul>
